## **Step 1: Install Gorilla Tag on PC**
1. Make sure you have Gorilla Tag installed on your PC through **Steam** or **Quest PC**.
2. Ensure that your PC meets the minimum requirements for running both the game and mods.

**Minimum Specs (according to the steam description):**

**OS:** Windows 10

**Processor:** Intel Core i5-4590 / AMD FX 8350

**Memory:** 4 GB RAM

**Graphics:** NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD Radeon R9 290

**Network:** Broadband Internet connection

**Storage:** 140 MB available space

**Sound Card:** n/a

**VR Support:** SteamVR or Oculus PC

**Additional Notes:** This runs on a Quest, so it should probably run on any reasonable computer that can run Oculus or SteamVR at all that isn't literally a toaster

## **Step 2: Download and Install BepInEx**
BepInEx is usually the mod loader used for Gorilla Tag.

1. Go to the [BepInEx GitHub page](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases).
2. Download `BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2.zip`.
   - It should be a `.zip` file.
3. Extract the zip file to your Gorilla Tag installation folder:
   - Default path for Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag`
   - Default path for Quest PC: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\another-axiom-gorilla-tag`
4. After extraction, run Gorilla Tag once to generate the necessary BepInEx files.

## **Step 5: Launch Gorilla Tag with Mods**
1. Open Steam or Quest PC and launch Gorilla Tag.
2. The mods should now be active.
3. **Important:** Only use mods in modded lobbies unless it doesn't give an advantage. Cheat menus are also not allowed **anywhere.** Even if it's a modded or private.

## **Optional: Troubleshooting**
- **Issue:** Mods are not working.  
  - Ensure BepInEx is installed correctly and run the game once to generate its files.
  - Check the modâ€™s compatibility with the current version of Gorilla Tag.
  
- **Issue:** Game crashes on startup.  
  - Remove recently added mods from the `plugins` folder and try launching the game again.

- **Tip:** Ping **@Helpers** in [MonkeMod](https://discord.gg/b2MhDBAzTv) if you need help. Be sure to be kind to the helpers :)
